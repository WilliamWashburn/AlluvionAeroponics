# AlluvionAeroponics

In this repository, there are the .ino files for all the controllers in the warehouse. Each controller has its own .ino file.

## IDE
I recommend opening these files in the Arduino IDE to upload. The IDE will tell you what libraries need to be installed when you try to compile them.

## Boards
I've used the Adafruit ESP32 Feather and Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2. You can read about these boards and how to use them on their website. [link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather)
